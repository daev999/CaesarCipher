# Caesar Cipher 🔐

A Python program that encrypts and decrypts messages using the classic Caesar Cipher technique.  
It shifts letters in the alphabet by a user-defined number to encode or decode text.

## Features
- Encode and decode text using letter shifting  
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters  
- Simple terminal-based interface  
- Includes ASCII art for a creative touch 🎨  

## How to Run
1. Open the project in **PyCharm** or **VS Code**.  
2. Run the file `main.py`.  
3. Follow the terminal prompts to choose **encode** or **decode**.  

## Example
encode
Type your message:
hello world
Type the shift number:
5
Here's the encoded result: mjqqt btwqi

## About
This project was written as part of my Python learning journey — practicing loops, functions, and text manipulation.
